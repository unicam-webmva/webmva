They're used to note the termination of a line, however, dealt with differently in today's popular Operating Systems. For example: in Windows both a CR and LF are required to note the end of a line, whereas in Linux/UNIX a LF is only required. This combination of CR and LR is used for example when pressing 'Enter' on the keyboard. Depending on the application being used, pressing 'Enter' generally instructs the application to start a new line, or to send a command."

#: ../language/vulnerability.py:120
msgid "Cross Site Scripting solution"
msgstr "The best way to protect a web application from XSS attacks is ensure that the application performs validation of all headers, cookies, query strings, form fields, and hidden fields. Encoding user supplied output in the server side can also defeat XSS vulnerabilities by preventing inserted scripts from being transmitted to users in an executable form. Applications can gain significant protection from javascript based attacks by converting the following characters in all generated output to the appropriate HTML entity encoding:  &lt;, &gt;, &amp;, &quot;, ', (, ), #, %, ; , +, -."

msgid "File Handling description"
msgstr "This attack is also known as Path or Directory Traversal, its aim is the access to files and directories that are stored outside the web root folder.

Use indexes rather than actual portions of file names when templating or using language files (eg: value 5 from the user submission = Czechoslovakian, rather than expecting the user to return 'Czechoslovakian'). Ensure the user cannot supply all parts of the path - surround it with your path code. Validate the user's input by only accepting known good - do not sanitize the data.
